<p>Hello, my name is Amber Blair!
Firstly, I am a dedicated mother, full-time employee, and aspiring educational leader with a passion for making a difference in the field of education. I have a strong commitment to personal and professional growth; I seek to shape the future of learning through my academic pursuits and real-world experiences.
Iâ€™m completing my undergraduate degree in Educational Studies, Academic Leadership, and policy analysis from the University of Missouri. I deeply understand the dynamics of education and its potential to transform lives. As a devoted mother of two, I draw inspiration from my children's educational journeys. This strongly motivates me to contribute meaningfully to the field.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I work full-time at UMKC, where I actively engage with the university community and contribute to the enhancement of educational programs and services. My hands-on experience provides me with invaluable insights into the practical aspects of education and strengthens my resolve to make a positive impact.</p>
My unwavering dedication to my family and career does not overshadow my diverse range of interests. As an avid true crime aficionado, I find solace and intellectual stimulation in exploring the intricate workings of criminal behavior and the pursuit of justice. I immerse myself in true crime literature, podcasts, and engaging discussions with fellow enthusiasts in my free time.</p>
