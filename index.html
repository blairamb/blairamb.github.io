This website aims to teach first-year Graduate Health students to utilize Project Concert per the clinical policy and procedures manual. Project Concert is a web-based system designed to track program data. The Master of Science in Anesthesia and Physician Assistant program uses Project Concert to record data. In addition to assessing students, faculty, and clinical sites. Students use Project Concert to document clinical experiences, hours worked, scheduling and evaluations, and evaluating clinical sites. Preceptors use Project Concert to evaluate student performances.
This website will demonstrate the basics of logging into Project Concert and entering basic student demographics. It will also demonstrate how to schedule daily clinical preceptor evaluations, enter the start and end times, and enter the case and patient information. After reviewing my content, students will be able to navigate Project Concert and record data in accordance with the clinical policy and procedures manual.
